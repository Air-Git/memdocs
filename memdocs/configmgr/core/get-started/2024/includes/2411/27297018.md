## <a name="bkmk_CMGSecurity"></a> Enhanced Security for CMG

CMG Setup now uses Managed Identities and third party **Server App** to interact with CMG's Azure Storage Account, instead of storage account keys.
Hence storage account key access will be disabled for new CMG Setup.

For existing session upgrading from earlier versions to 2409. "CMG enhanced security" button will be shown as enabled. 
Clicking which will disable storage account key access.

On selecting the enhanced security option. VMSS OS Auto Upgrade feature will also be enabled. 
The admin will see an extra panel asking to fill in maintenance window details. Azure will use these to schedule upgrades if there are new OS images available.
